3. **Summary**

	I’d describe myself as a goal-oriented and hardworking person. I am ready for work and difficulties that I may encounter. I will try and learn as fast as possible. 
	
	I have no experience of development in comercial project. After working the past half year as an engineer, I’ve developed a number of important skills, including decision-making and multitasking. Furthermore, I used to serve in the army. There I learned to cope with any life difficulties. 
	
	That all background will help me achieve all goals. It’s impossible to predict the future, but my main goal is to become successful. 
	
	In my free time I enjoy walking with my friends and bicycling. It provides me with a good balance in my life.
